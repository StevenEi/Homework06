Homework 06 Weather Dashboard

## What I Learned
I got some good practice with pinging third party API's and accessing their data using the fetch() and .then() methods. I also got some more practice with creating, fixing up and appending HTML elements through javascript. I had some issues with not knowing the jquery commands to do some of the things I needed so I had to fall back on vanilla javascript.

## Difficulties that I had
I had some issues with storing the current and future conditions of a city that was already clicked on, not sure how to connect all of that data from local storage into a button. I was also a little confused with the for-loop for the five-day forecast but was eventually able to finish it with the help of my tutor.
